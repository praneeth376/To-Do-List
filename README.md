# To-Do-List

The To-Do List application is a simple web-based task management system designed to help users organize and keep track of their tasks. The project utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an intuitive and user-friendly interface for managing to-do items. The application includes key features such as due dates, priority levels (low, medium, high), task categories, and task status (new, in progress, completed).

Users can interact with the application through a clean and responsive user interface. The tasks are stored locally in the browser's storage using JavaScript's localStorage, allowing for data persistence even after the browser is closed. The application provides a form for users to input task details, including the title, description, due date, priority, and category. Users can add tasks, view a list of existing tasks, and remove tasks as needed.

The goal of this project is to provide a foundational example of a To-Do List application that can be further customized and expanded upon. Users can adapt the code to include additional features, enhance the styling, or integrate it with a backend server and database for more advanced functionality and data storage.

**To set up and run the To-Do List application**, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites:

- A text editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text)
- A web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Firefox)

### Steps:

1. **Create Project Folder:**
   - Create a new folder on your computer to contain the project files.

2. **Create HTML File:**
   - Open your text editor and create a new file with the name `index.html`.
   - Copy and paste the provided HTML code into `index.html`.

3. **Create CSS File:**
   - Create a new file with the name `styles.css`.
   - Copy and paste the provided CSS code into `styles.css`.

4. **Create JavaScript File:**
   - Create a new file with the name `app.js`.
   - Copy and paste the provided JavaScript code into `app.js`.

5. **Open in Browser:**
   - Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.
   - You can do this by right-clicking the file and selecting "Open with" and choosing your browser.

6. **Test the Application:**
   - The To-Do List application should open in your web browser.
   - Add tasks using the form, and they should appear in the list below.
   - Test the functionality, including adding and removing tasks.

### Usage Tips:

- **Local Storage:**
  - The application uses local storage to save tasks, so the data will persist even if you close the browser window.
  - You can clear the stored tasks by clearing your browser's local storage or modifying the `localStorage` in the browser's developer tools.
