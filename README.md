# To-Do-List

The To-Do List application is a simple web-based task management system designed to help users organize and keep track of their tasks. The project utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an intuitive and user-friendly interface for managing to-do items. The application includes key features such as due dates, priority levels (low, medium, high), task categories, and task status (new, in progress, completed).

Users can interact with the application through a clean and responsive user interface. The tasks are stored locally in the browser's storage using JavaScript's localStorage, allowing for data persistence even after the browser is closed. The application provides a form for users to input task details, including the title, description, due date, priority, and category. Users can add tasks, view a list of existing tasks, and remove tasks as needed.

The goal of this project is to provide a foundational example of a To-Do List application that can be further customized and expanded upon. Users can adapt the code to include additional features, enhance the styling, or integrate it with a backend server and database for more advanced functionality and data storage.
